## About Eclipse Che
Eclipse Che is a next generation Eclipse IDE and open source alternative to IntelliJ. This repository is licensed under the Eclipse Public License 1.0.

Che Dashboard
==============

#Requirements
- Node.js `v4.x.x` (`v5.x.x` / `v6.x.x` are currently not supported)
- npm
- Bower
- gulp
- typings

Installation instructions for Node.js and npm can be found on the following [link](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node). Bower and gulp are CLI utilities which are installed via npm:

```sh
$ npm install --global bower gulp typings
```

#Quick start

```sh
cd che/dashboard
mvn clean install
```

## Running
In order to run the project, the serve command is used
```sh
$ gulp serve
```
It will launch the server and then the project can be tested on http://localhost:3000

By default it will use http://localhost:8080 as a remote server, so make sure that Che is running locally. More details about how to do that can be found on the following [link](https://github.com/eclipse/che/wiki/Development-Workflow#build-and-run---tomcat)  

The argument `--server <url>` may allow to use another server. (url is for example http://my-server.com)


```sh
$ gulp serve:dist
```
This command will provide the 'minified/optimised' version of the application

This is a good check for testing if the final rendering is OK


## Tests
The application contains both unit tests and e2e tests (end-to-end)

Unit tests
```sh
$ gulp test
```

e2e tests
```sh
$ gulp protractor
```

Both tests
```sh
$ gulp alltests
```

Note: before pushing contribution, these tests should always work

#Architecture design

## Ecmascript 2015/es6

This new version is using the new feature of Javascript language with a transpiler named babel (previously 6to5)

So application is written with the new language but the resulting build is Javascript v5 compliant

Among new features, Class, arrow functions, etc

## Styling/css
[Stylus](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus) is used for produced the final CSS.

Variables, simple syntax, etc is then provided


## Code convention

### indent
There is a .editorconfig file that is indicating the current identation which is
```
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2
```

### syntax
The syntax is checked by jshint (through .jshintrc file)

Also when launching gulp serve command, there is a report on each file that may have invalid data

For example use single quote 'hello', no "double quote", use === and !=== and not == or !=


### name of the files
Controllers are in files named <name>.controller.js

Directives: <name>.directive.js

Templates: <name>.html

Factories: <name>.factory.js

Unit test: <name>.spec.js (for my-example.factory.js will be named my-example.spec.js)

#### About e2e tests
If a 'project' page needs to be tested:

project.po.js will contain the Page Object pattern (all methods allowing to get HTML elements on the page)

project.spec.js will have the e2e test

project.mock.js will provide some mock for the test

## source tree
Each 'page' needs to have its own folder which include:

controller, directive, template, style for the page

for a 'list-projects' page, the folder tree will have
```
list-projects
  - list-projects.controller.js
  - list-projects.html
  - list-projects.styl
```

## AngularJS recommandation
As classes are available, the controller will be designed as es6 classes.

All injection required will be done through the constructor by adding also the @ngInject annotation.

Also properties are bound with this. scope (so avoid to use $scope in injection as this will be more aligned with AngularJS 2.0 where scope will disappear)

example
```js
/**
 * Defines a controller
 * @author Florent Benoit
 */
class CheToggleCtrl {

  /**
   * Constructor that is using resource injection
   * @ngInject for Dependency injection
   */
  constructor ($http) {
    this.$http = $http; // to use $http in other methods, use this.$http
    this.selectedValue = 'hello';
  }

  exampleMethod() {
    return this.selectedValue;
  }

}

export default CheToggleCtrl;

```

So, no need to add specific arrays for injection.


By using the this syntax, the controllerAs needs to be used when adding the router view
```js
    .when('/myURL', {
      templateUrl: 'mytemplate.html',
      controller: 'MyClassCtrl',
      controllerAs: 'myCtrl'
    })
```

And then, when there is a need to interact with code of a controller, the controllerAs value is used.

```html
 <div>Selected book is {{myCtrl.selectedBook}}</div>
```
Note that as if scope was using, the values are always prefixed

## Directives

The whole idea is to be able to reuse some 'widgets' when designing HTML pages

So instead that each page make the design/css for all buttons, inputs, it should be defined in some widget components.

The components are located in the src/components/widget folder

It includes toggle buttons, selecter, etc.

A demo page is also provided to browse them: localhost:5000/#/demo-components


## API of Che

Each call to the Che API shouldn't be made directly from the controller of the page.
For that, it has to use Che API fatories which are handling the job (with promises operations)

By injecting 'cheAPI' inside a controller, all operations can be called.

for example cheAPI.getWorkspace().getWorkspaces() for getting the array of the current workspaces of the user

Mocks are also provided for the Che API, allowing to emulate a real backend for unit tests or e2e tests
